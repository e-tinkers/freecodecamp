freeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer challenge - JavaScript
======================================================

This implementation uses pure Javascript. It is shorter than using React and much easier to understand. However, the code in React probably landed you a job, while this code may not. LOL...

See the React version at [here](https://github.com/e-tinkers/freecodecamp/tree/master/front-end-libraries/markdown-previewer-react).

See [live demo](https://e-tinkers.github.io/freecodecamp/front-end-libraries/markdown-previewer-js/index.html)
