freeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer challenge - React
=========================================

This implementation uses React. However, I noticed that you can achieved the same result with pure JavaScript with only 5 lines of code, excluding all the common codes shared by both JavaScript and React implementations, and a helper function `escape()` which is required in JavaScript implementation but not in React. For this particular project, React is an overkill and take much of thinking as well as typing than pure [JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/e-tinkers/freecodecamp/tree/master/front-end-libraries/markdown-previewer-js). My take away from this exercise is: **Use the right tool for the right job.**
