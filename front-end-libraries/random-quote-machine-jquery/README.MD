## Random Quotes Machine - jQuery
This is one of [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)'s Front End Libraries project. Boostrap and jQuery are used as per project requirements, this however can easily be done without those frameworks. I later on did a version using React which is available [here](https://github.com/e-tinkers/freecodecamp/tree/master/front-end-libraries/random-quotes-react).
