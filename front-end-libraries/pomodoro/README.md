Pomodoro Clock
==============

This is freeCodeCamp [Pomodoro Clock](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock) project implementation using React.

This is a working in progress. The code failed this test:

    10. If the timer is running and I click the element with id="start_stop", the countdown should pause.
    Pomodoro has paused but time continued elapsing: expected '55' to equal '57'
