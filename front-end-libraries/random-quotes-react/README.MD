## Random Quotes Machine - React
This is one of [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)'s Front End Libraries project. It was first implemented using jQuery and later ported it over to use React library. The jQuery version is available [here](https://github.com/e-tinkers/freecodecamp/tree/master/front-end-libraries/random-quote-machine-jquery).

See [live demo](https://e-tinkers.github.io/freecodecamp/front-end-libraries/random-quotes-react/index.html)
