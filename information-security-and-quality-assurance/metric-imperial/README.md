# Metric - Imperial Converter 

This is my solution to FreeCodeCamp Information Security and Quality Assurance Projects - [Metric-Imperial Converter](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/information-security-and-quality-assurance/information-security-and-quality-assurance-projects/metric-imperial-converter).

See finished project [live demo](https://tremendous-spinach.glitch.me).
------
## Original README instruction from the project

1) SET NODE_ENV to `test` without quotes
2) Most logic will need done in `controllers/convertHandler.js` but do complete `routes/api.js`
3) You will add any security features to `server.js`
4) You will create all of the functional/unit tests in tests/2_functional-tests.js and tests/1_unit-tests.js
